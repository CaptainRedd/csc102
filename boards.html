            So far it's been a lot of head-scratching about why on earth one change affected another element, followed by a great 
            deal of poking and prodding until finally whatever happens to be a bother falls into place. Good old trial and error.

            Blast! I've just wasted almost two whole hours attempting to change the color of a specific JavaScript variable, to no avail... 
            I suspect it would involve rewriting the function and divs, but that would render the existing divs redundant. I'll need to move on, though...

                    Here I am, almost 12 hours later - coding the entire way. How fortuitous is it for me that this next assignment 
                    specifically addresses the functions I was attempting to impliment in the previous validation assignment. I expect that 
                    should be updated by the end of this, and I'm thankful I won't have to rely on google to figure out how that works. 
                    What a pain that was.

                So far, so good. I was a bit behind, but for the most part I've caught up. I've <span style=color:aquamarine;>condensed my scripts into one file, 
                but I had to keep the palindrome checker separate.</span> It was causing scripts to run whenever I attempted to open any page,
                 usually practice.html, then sent me to validation.html when the script ended. I think it's the do while loop, since it's 
                 the only script that doesn't effectively end without conditional input and the javascript file is called on every page. 
                 I still want to <span style=color:gold;>figure out how to use that concept to open validation every time a page is opened, 
                and then redirect to index.html on success and have that result be persistent for the user</span>- essentially functioning 
                as a password, without having to store those credentials.

                I also <span style=color:aquamarine;>cleaned up the code a bit,</span> and <span style=color:aquamarine;>added nav to game.html and strings.html</span>
                 to be able to return home without opening the index.html manually. I do also still want to <span style=color:gold;>figure out how to make the specific integer produced by 
                rollDie a different color,</span> and <span style=color:gold;>generate text in a position relative to the position of 
                cunningPlan.png when a user clicks the srtbtn or stpbtn.</span> I wanted to <span style=color:gold;>add a little more depth to 
                index</span> as well, and to that end I've <span style=color:aquamarine;>added an ID for each div holding a log entry.</span> I should probably read more of the supplemental 
                reading material, but I tend to have a hard time retaining that much information at once without practically copying it word-for-word by 
                hand and I don't always have that kind of time. I might also <span style=color:gold;>add a table of contents nav menu for Log entries</span>, once I figure out how.
