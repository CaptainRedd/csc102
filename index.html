            There's going to be a lot to learn here.

            Let's get started.

                So far it's been a lot of head-scratching about why on earth one change affected another element, followed by a great deal of poking and prodding until finally whatever happens to be a bother falls into place. Good old trial and error.

                Blast! I've just wasted almost two whole hours attempting to change the color of a specific JavaScript variable, to no avail... I suspect it would involve rewriting the function and divs, but that would render the existing divs redundant. I'll need to move on, though...

                Here I am, almost 12 hours later - coding the entire way. How fortuitous is it for me that this next assignment specifically addresses the functions I was attempting to impliment in the previous validation assignment. I except that should be updated by the end of this, and I'm thankful I won't have to rely on google to figure out how that works. What a pain that was.
